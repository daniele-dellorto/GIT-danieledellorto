          <p>DanDee project comes from the attitude of two guys to look
           around and discover beauty in everyday reality. In a world that runs faster and
           faster and where people have no time to stop and look at each other, paying attention to
           what surrounds us is the first way to reappropriate our context and understand
           what we are. </p>
        <p>The shots that you will find in the gallery are all made with analog cameras
           and are home developed. Analog photography most of all forces you to accurately
           design the shot, choose the angle and the point of view. This means that you
           have to do an extremely careful analysis of the subject. you are forced
           to know your reality. </p>
